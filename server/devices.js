/**
 * The computers an account can reach.
 *
 * There used to be one token per account, kept in a column on `users`, and
 * generating a token for a second machine silently invalidated the first. So
 * "sign in anywhere and your computer is there" was only ever true for one
 * computer — pair the laptop and the desktop went dark, with nothing in the
 * interface to say why. A person has both. A team member has a work machine and
 * a home one. Each gets its own row and its own token now, revocable on its own.
 *
 * Pairing is deliberately the shape a television uses, and the direction matters:
 *
 *   1. The worker starts with no token, asks for a code, prints it, and polls.
 *   2. Somebody already signed in types that code into the app.
 *   3. That claim — made by an authenticated person — is what attaches the
 *      machine to their account and mints its token.
 *   4. The worker's next poll collects the token and writes it to worker/.env.
 *
 * An unauthenticated request can therefore only ever ask to be adopted. It
 * cannot name an account, read anything, or do anything at all until a real
 * person decides it belongs to them.

 *
 * **The direction is the security property, and reversing it costs something.**
 * A code cannot be phished, because it travels from the machine to its owner. A
 * token travels the other way, so it can be handed to somebody — "paste this to
 * activate your trial" — and the machine that pastes it belongs to whoever
 * minted the token. On a deployment anybody can register on, that is a malware
 * distribution channel wearing the app as a costume.
 *
 * So redeeming happens in two steps, and the first one is not optional:
 * `previewEnrolment` says which account is about to be given the files, the
 * shell and the screen of this computer, and the installer refuses to continue
 * until a human types YES. Somebody can still be talked into typing it — but
 * that is an informed decision rather than a paste that looked harmless.
 *
 * The token is a secret in a command line, and command lines end up in shell
 * history. Ten minutes and one use each; that bounds it rather than fixing it.
