/**
 * One id that follows a request all the way through.
 *
 * An agent turn here is not one thing that happens. It is an SSE connection, a
 * loop that runs up to `maxSteps` times, a provider call per step that may
 * silently move to a second key, a fan of tool calls, some of which cross to a
 * different process on the user's own machine and come back through a database
 * queue. When somebody reports "it hung for two minutes and then said something
 * odd", the evidence for that is spread across all of those and there was
 * nothing to join it on: twenty-four unstructured `console.log`s and no shared
 * identifier anywhere in the server, the worker, or the browser.
 *
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` is what makes this cost nothing at the call sites. The id
 * is put in scope once, in one middleware, and every function underneath it —
 * however deep, across every `await` — can read it without being passed it. No
 * signature in the agent loop changes, which matters: threading a parameter
 * through forty functions is how this kind of thing gets started and then
 * abandoned half done.
 *
 * The browser sends `x-request-id` when it has one and reads it back off the
 * response, so a report from a user can carry the id of the exact turn.
