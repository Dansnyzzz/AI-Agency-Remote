/**
 * MCP servers worth suggesting, so plugging one in is a button rather than
 * research.
 *
 * The problem this solves: the MCP panel asks for a command, and somebody who has
 * never seen one has no idea what to type. Every entry here is a real server with
 * a real install command, so the panel can offer a list and fill the field in.
 *
 * **Where these came from.** The first three were read off this machine's own
 * Claude Code plugin cache — the `.mcp.json` files under
 * `~/.claude/plugins/cache` — so they are the exact commands already working here
 * rather than something remembered from documentation. The rest are the official
 * reference servers.
 *
 * Nothing here is installed or run by adding it to this file. The user still
 * presses Connect, the command is still tried before it is stored, and every tool
 * a server offers still stops for approval. This is a list of suggestions, and
 * that is all it is.
 *
 * `needs` names an environment variable or header the server wants. Said out loud
 * rather than discovered when the first call fails.
