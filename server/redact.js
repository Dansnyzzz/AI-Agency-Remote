/**

 * conversation, so a secret that lands there is a secret that keeps escaping.
 *
 * This is a filter, not a guarantee. It catches the shapes credentials usually
 * come in — long random-looking tokens, `KEY=value` assignments, the well-known
 * provider prefixes — and it will miss ones that look like ordinary words.
 * Treat it as a safety net under a rule you still have to follow, which is not

   * OpenAI's bare `sk-…`.
   *
   * This replaces four hand-written prefixes, and the reason is a hole they
   * left. OrcaRouter was added as a provider without being added here, so its
   * keys were redacted by nothing: the old catch-all `sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{32,}`
   * cannot cross the hyphen in `sk-orca-`, and stops after four characters.
   * A key that leaks is not a place to keep a list somebody has to remember to
   * update — see the suite, which now asserts this against every provider in
   * the catalogue rather than against a sample somebody typed.
   *
   * What keeps it off ordinary prose is that the tail must be **unbroken**: a
   * key ends in a long run with no hyphens in it, while English written with
   * hyphens does not. `sk-onboarding-checklist-for-new-people` never assembles
   * 24 characters without hitting a hyphen, so it survives untouched.
   *
   * The cost of that choice is honest and small: a 24-character unhyphenated
   * word after `sk-` would be redacted. Erring that way is the right direction
   * here, and the suite pins the prose that must not be touched.
