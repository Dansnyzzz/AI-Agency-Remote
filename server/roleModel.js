/**
 * Not every model call in a turn deserves the turn's model.
 *
 * A conversation set to Opus is set to Opus because the *answering* is worth it.
 * Then the same model gets used to fold the older turns into a summary, to pull
 * three prices off a web page, and to turn one question into four search
 * queries — none of which is reasoning, and all of which were being billed at
 * the flagship rate. On a long conversation the compaction call is routinely the
 * largest single prompt the account sends, and it is a writing job.
 *
 * So the roles that copy, reformat and summarise get a cheap model, and the
 * roles that decide keep the expensive one. The split is deliberately
 * conservative: anything that reasons about the user's actual question stays
 * where it was, because a cheap model that summarises badly loses the decisions
 * a conversation rests on, and that is not a saving.

/**
 * Which roles may be moved, and what they are.

 *   compaction  Rewriting a transcript as prose. The largest prompt in the app,

 *   extract     Copying stated facts off a page. The prompt already forbids
 *               inference in as many words.
 *   plan        One question into a handful of search queries. Rewriting.
 *
 * Everything absent from this list — the turn itself, sub-agents, and every
 * role of the research debate — keeps the conversation's model, because each of
 * them is answering rather than transcribing.

 * rather than an oversight. So today this moves Anthropic conversations and
 * leaves the others exactly where they were.
 *
 * That is the right failure. "Probably cheaper" is not a thing to decide on
 * somebody else's bill, and a curated list that quietly routed a
 * `gemini-flash-lite` conversation *up* to `gemini-flash` would cost money while

 *   2. An explicit `prefs.cheapModel` wins, because somebody who set it meant it.
 *   3. Otherwise the small model of the *same provider* — staying on one
 *      provider keeps the failure modes and the billing in one place, and needs
 *      no key lookup, because a turn already running there proves the key.
 *
 * Falls back to `entry` at every step. A role that cannot be moved cheaply runs
 * where it was rather than failing, which is the only acceptable behaviour for
 * something that sits in the middle of a turn.
