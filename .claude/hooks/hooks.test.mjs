 *

 * `pending` is written by the PostToolUse hook for every edit in the session,

 * read-only sub-agent inherited a state it had no part in, had no diff to prove,
 * and was usually forbidden by its own brief from running the gate. Nothing it

 *
 * A first attempt narrowed it to `pending.length === 0` and failed for the same
 * reason: `pending` held a file the *parent* had just edited, so every
 * sub-agent dispatched during ordinary work was still blocked. The data needed
 * to tell the two apart is not recorded anywhere.
 *
 * The cost was measured, not assumed. The message the hook blocks is the agent's
 * report; its next message answers the hook instead, and that is what reaches
 * the parent. Eleven reports were lost that way in one session across six
 * agents, two of which had to be dispatched again from nothing.
 *
 * Dropping it is safe because the requirement moves rather than disappears. A
 * sub-agent does not commit and does not ship. If it edited source, `pending`
 * names those files and the **parent** is stopped at its own Stop until the gate
 * has run over them. That is the pair asserted here: one ledger, one sentence,
