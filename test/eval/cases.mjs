/**
 * What "working correctly" means for the agent, written down as cases.
 *
 * Everything else in `test/` pins code: given this input, that output. None of
 * it can say whether the assistant *chooses well* — whether it reaches for the
 * user's own documents rather than the web when the question is about their
 * files, whether it stops at a sign-in page instead of hunting for a way past
 * it, whether a research claim is attached to a source that exists. Those are
 * the failures people actually report, and until now the only detector for them
 * was somebody complaining.
 *
 * Each case is written once and read two ways.
 *
 * **Scripted** (`npm run eval`) checks the conditions for the right answer:
 * that the tool the case expects is actually on offer in that situation, that
 * the system prompt still says the thing the case depends on, that the
 * enforcement the case relies on exists. It needs no key, costs nothing, and
 * runs in CI. It cannot tell you the model chose well — only that it was given
 * the chance to.
 *
 * **Live** (`npm run eval:live`) runs the same cases against a real model and
 * measures what it actually did. That costs money and is not deterministic, so
 * it is a nightly job rather than a merge gate.
 *
 * The split is the honest one: most regressions here are the scaffolding
 * quietly changing underneath the model — a tool dropped from the catalogue, a
 * paragraph edited out of the prompt — and those are catchable for free.
