/**
 * Set the document language before anything else runs.
 *
 * `i18n.js` already does this — but it is an ES module at the bottom of a graph
 * eleven imports deep, so it runs well after the body has been parsed. First
 * paint is exactly when somebody using a screen reader starts reading, and until
 * then the document claimed `lang="en"` over Vietnamese text. A screen reader
 * acts on that: it applies English pronunciation rules to Vietnamese words,
 * which lands closer to unintelligible than to accented.
 *
 * Deliberately not a module and deliberately duplicating a few lines of
 * `initialLanguage`. A module would be deferred, which puts it back after the
 * parse; importing the real thing would pull the whole locale graph into the
 * critical path to set one attribute. The duplication is four lines and the two
 * copies agree on one storage key, which is the part that has to match.
