# SKILL_MAP — what is installed, and what this audit will actually use

Written 2026-09-09. This file did not exist before, which is itself a finding
(`CFG-013`): PHẦN II of the audit rules requires every phase to open with
`Skill nạp lượt này: [...]` **theo `audit/SKILL_MAP.md`**, and there was no such
file for that declaration to be checked against.

Source of the list: the skills and MCP servers enumerated in this session's own
tool manifest. Nothing here is guessed; where a capability could not be
confirmed it says `[UNKNOWN]`.

## 2. Routing table

| Skill/Plugin | Phase | What it replaces or speeds up | Risk | Quyết định |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gitnexus-exploring` / `impact_analysis` / `trace` | 1, 2 | Building the call graph by hand before touching a shared symbol | Index may be stale against the working tree | **DÙNG CÓ ĐIỀU KIỆN** — `detect_changes` first; an answer from a stale index is not a `[FACT]` |
| `gitnexus-taint-analysis` / `pdg_query` | 1 §E | Manual source→sink tracing for injection | Findings are leads, not proof | **DÙNG CÓ ĐIỀU KIỆN** — every hit re-read by hand before it enters the ledger |
| `gitnexus-review` | 3 | Multi-axis review of the branch diff | Reads a diff it did not write — that is the value | **DÙNG** at Phase 3 |
| `gitnexus-work` / `gitnexus-lfg` | — | Executes plans and **commits** on its own gating | Writes code and runs git; collides with the Phase 0/1 no-edit rule and with PHẦN III | **KHÔNG DÙNG** — see `CFG-017` |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | 2 | Structured root-cause work when a fix goes red | None | **DÙNG** when the gate is red |
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | 2 | Failing-test-first per ID | None | **DÙNG** |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | 2, 3 | Blocks a "done" claim with no command output behind it | None — it restates this audit's §2 | **DÙNG** |
| `superpowers:requesting-code-review` + `.claude/agents/code-reviewer` | 3 | Cold read of the finished diff | Subagents have died to session rate limits twice in this repo's history | **DÙNG**, one at a time, with an explicit "report partial findings" instruction |
| `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | 4 | Deciding how work integrates | **Its remit includes merging** | **DÙNG CÓ ĐIỀU KIỆN** — advice only; no git command from it is executed |
| `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` | 2 | Isolating the work | An extra checkout a solo repo does not need | **KHÔNG DÙNG** |
| `.claude/skills/token-budget` | 1 §D, §H | Per-step vs per-turn cost, already reasoned for this repo | Headline numbers are stale — see `CODE-015` | **DÙNG**, numbers re-measured |
| `.claude/skills/accessibility-checklist` | 1 §G | The WCAG pass over `public/` | None | **DÙNG** |
| `.claude/skills/api-conventions` | 1 §C, 2 | Route shape, auth, error contract | **Says every route lives in `server/app.js` — false since ARCH-004.** See `CODE-013` | **DÙNG CÓ ĐIỀU KIỆN** until corrected |
| `claude-mem:mem-search` | 0 | Recovering prior-session findings not in the ledger | Returns recollections, not evidence | **DÙNG CÓ ĐIỀU KIỆN** — output is a lead, never a `[FACT]` |
| `claude-mem:learn-codebase` | 0 | Reading the tree | Reads every file in full — enormous context for a 76k-line repo already inventoried | **KHÔNG DÙNG** |
| `repomix:pack-local` | 0 | Packing the repo for bulk analysis | Duplicates `audit/INVENTORY.md`, which exists | **KHÔNG DÙNG** |
| `context7:docs` | 1 §3, 2 | Current API signatures before writing against an SDK — CLAUDE.md §3 requires looking up rather than guessing | None | **DÙNG** when touching an SDK |
| `claude-api` | 1 §D, §H | Model ids, pricing, caching, token counting | None | **DÙNG** |
| `code-review` (built-in) / `simplify` | 3 | Diff review | Overlaps `gitnexus-review` and `code-reviewer` — three reviewers is context waste | **DÙNG 1 TRONG 3**: the `code-reviewer` agent by default; `gitnexus-review` when the change is graph-shaped |
| `security-review` (built-in) | 3 | Security pass over the branch | Overlaps `.claude/agents/security-auditor`, which is written for *this* threat model | **KHÔNG DÙNG** — the project agent is strictly better here |
| `design`, `dataviz`, `artifact-*`, `developing-with-streamlit`, `wowerpoint`, `design-is` | — | Nothing in this audit | Pure context weight | **KHÔNG DÙNG** |
| `claude-mem` timeline / digest / version-bump / oh-my-issues / babysit / standup | — | Nothing in this audit | Several run git or GitHub operations | **KHÔNG DÙNG** |
| `loop`, `schedule`, `CronCreate` | — | Nothing in this audit | Would run unattended turns past the phase stop points | **KHÔNG DÙNG** |
| Ahrefs MCP | — | — | Not authenticated | **KHÔNG DÙNG — [UNKNOWN]** |

## 3. Conflicts with the audit rules

| # | Skill | The conflict | Ledger ID |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gitnexus-work`, `gitnexus-lfg` | Both implement *and* gate their own commits (`detect_changes` gating every commit). That is a second git authority beside PHẦN III, and it edits code — forbidden in Phase 0/1. | `CFG-017` |
| 2 | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | Its whole subject is how to integrate finished work, including merging. PHẦN III reserves that for the owner. | `CFG-017` |
| 3 | `claude-mem:version-bump` | Tags, releases and publishes. `guard-bash.js` blocks `npm publish`, but nothing stops the tagging and GitHub-release steps. | `CFG-017` |
| 4 | `code-review` vs `gitnexus-review` vs `.claude/agents/code-reviewer` | Three reviewers for one job. | resolved above, no ID |
| 5 | `security-review` vs `.claude/agents/security-auditor` | Two security passes; the generic one does not know this app's threat model. | resolved above, no ID |
| 6 | `superpowers:using-superpowers` | Instructs that a skill MUST be invoked before any response, including clarifying questions. PHẦN I §6 puts this file above skills, and §4 caps skill loading per phase. | resolved by §6 precedence; declared each phase |

**None of these skills can run git in this session without passing
`guard-bash.js` first** — which is the real enforcement. But see `CFG-012`:
that guard's branch protection is currently **switched off**.

## 4. Gaps — what no skill covers

- **Measuring this app's own token spend per turn.** `token-budget` explains the
  model; nothing measures it. Done by hand via `availableTools({ context })`.
- **End-to-end latency and LLM calls per request.** Needs a live provider key.
  No skill substitutes for that, and it stays `[UNKNOWN]`.
- **Verifying repo visibility.** `gh` is not installed; no skill reads it.
- **The exposure classification.** Deciding what a public repo should not carry
  is a judgement about this business, and no skill holds that context.
